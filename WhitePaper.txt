Thought about yield curve spread project for a couple of seconds
Below is a step-by-step guide to help you design and execute a self-contained 
research project focusing on yield curve spreads. You’ll walk away with a 
structured, end-to-end framework that combines data science, quantitative 
analysis, and a bit of trading strategy design.

1. Research Question
Sample Primary Question
“Does the 2-year/10-year U.S. Treasury yield spread exhibit mean-reversion 
characteristics that can be leveraged for a trading strategy or 
predictive analysis?”

You could tailor this further. For example:

“Do changes in the 2-10 Treasury spread provide leading indicators for economic
 slowdowns?” “What trading opportunities exist if the yield curve spread 
 deviates substantially from its historical average?”
